RELATION WITH SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:
Stance detection is related to sentiment analysis, but the two have significant differences. In sentiment analysis, systems determine whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. However, in stance detection, systems are to determine the author's favorability towards a given target. The target may or may not be explicitly mentioned in the text. And the text may express opinion or sentiment about some other entity.


Classes: 
The possible stance labels are:

FAVOR: We can infer from the tweet that the tweeter supports the target (e.g., directly or indirectly by supporting someone/something, by opposing or criticizing someone/something opposed to the target, or by echoing the stance of somebody else).
 
AGAINST: We can infer from the tweet that the tweeter is against the target (e.g., directly or indirectly by opposing or criticizing someone/something, by supporting someone/something opposed to the target, or by echoing the stance of somebody else).
 
NONE: none of the above.



Quellen für Paper:

Recently BERT-based models are applied in NLP tasks, that is the hybrid of BERT and Artificial Intelligence techniques like RNN (Kula, Choraś & Kozik, 2020),CNN (Kaliyar, Goswami & Narang, 2021) and both (Ding, Hu & Chang, 2020). BERT models have also proved its importance to deal with multi-modal news articles (Zhang et al., 2020).(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8053013/)
